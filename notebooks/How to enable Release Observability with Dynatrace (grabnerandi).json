This works for both Windows and Linux. For examples in the [doc](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/platform-modules/cloud-automation/release-monitoring/version-detection-strategies#environment-variables)\n\n```\nset DT_RELEASE_VERSION=2.23\nset DT_RELEASE_BUILD_VERSION=2023-09-13\nset DT_RELEASE_PRODUCT=hipstershop\nset DT_RELEASE_STAGE=production\n```\n\n## Option 2: Providing it as K8s Labels\nOn K8s Dynatrace can also extract this information from K8s labels as shown below. Additionally it is recommended to pass release version information as an enviornment-variable to the container. This allows Dynatrace to enrich captured distributed traces with version information on each trace!\n\nMore information in the [doc](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/platform-modules/cloud-automation/release-monitoring/version-detection-strategies#kubernetes).\n\n```\napiVersion: apps/v1\nkind: Deployment\nmetadata:\n  namespace: production\n  name: adservice\nspec:\n  template:\n    metadata:\n      labels:\n        app.kubernetes.io/name: adservice\n        app.kubernetes.io/version: 2.23          // will be identified as version\n        app.kubernetes.io/part-of: hipstershop   // will be identified as product\n        dt.owner: team-ninja                     // will be identified as owner\n\n  ...\n  \n    spec:\n      containers:\n      - name: adservice\n        image: adservice:2.23\n        env:\n        - name: DT_RELEASE_VERSION               // propagates version information on distributed trace\n          valueFrom:\n            fieldRef:\n              fieldPath: metadata.labels['app.kubernetes.io/version'] \n  \n```\n\n## Option 3: Sending Deployment Events\nDynatrace also extracts version information through CUSTOM_DEPLOYMENT events that are sent to a Dynatrace Monitored entity. The mandatory field there is `dt.event.deployment.version`\nTypically those events are sent by the CI/CD pipeline tools (Jenkins, GitLab, GitHub, ...) after a new version was deployed!\nMore details on the [doc](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/platform-modules/cloud-automation/release-monitoring/version-detection-strategies#events-ingestion)\n\n```\n{\n  \"eventType\": \"CUSTOM_DEPLOYMENT\",\n  \"title\": \"Easytravel 1.1\",\n  \"entitySelector\": \"type(PROCESS_GROUP_INSTANCE),tag(easytravel)\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"dt.event.deployment.name\":\"Easytravel 1.1\",\n    \"dt.event.deployment.version\": \"1.1\",\n    \"dt.event.deployment.release_stage\": \"production\" ,\n    \"dt.event.deployment.release_product\": \"frontend\",\n    \"dt.event.deployment.release_build_version\": \"123\",\n    \"approver\": \"Jason Miller\",\n    \"dt.event.deployment.ci_back_link\": \"https://pipelines/easytravel/123\",\n    \"gitcommit\": \"e5a6baac7eb\",\n    \"change-request\": \"CR-42\",\n    \"dt.event.deployment.remediation_action_link\": \"https://url.com\",\n    \"dt.event.is_rootcause_relevant\": true\n  }\n}\n```"},{"id":"0a786b4f-1839-434b-989d-53e234e490b9","type":"markdown","markdown":"---"},{"id":"c0f65a02-1004-46cb-9197-b43af7111185","type":"markdown","markdown":"# Step 2: Release Inventory: Overview of all release versions\nThe [Release inventory](https://wkf10640.apps.dynatrace.com/ui/apps/dynatrace.classic.releases/ui/releases?gtf=-2h&gf=all&invsc=releaseName&invsd=asc) gives you an overview of all deployed releases on the observed environment.
