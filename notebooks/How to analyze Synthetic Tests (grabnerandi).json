Analyze Synthetic Monitor Executions and Identify Root Causes of Failures\n**Problem Statement:** As a Kubernetes Admin I need to quickly know whether my clusters and workloads are running as expected and whether there are no vulnerabilities!\n\n**How Dynatrace helps:** Dynatrace provides some out-of-the-box dashboards and views to get a quick overview of K8s Cluster and Workload Health as well as highlights any known vulnerabilities.\n\n**Steps**:\n1. Open the [Synthetic App](https://wkf10640.apps.dynatrace.com/ui/apps/dynatrace.classic.kubernetes/ui/kubernetes)\n2. Select a test of interesting (expand timeframe, locate tests that have issues, then click) ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dynatrace-perfclinics/dynatrace-getting-started/main/images/howto_synthetic_monitoroverview.png)\n3. Pick an Availability Issue timeframe to analyze ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dynatrace-perfclinics/dynatrace-getting-started/main/images/howto_synthetic_availabilityoverview.png)\n4. Focus on a specific synthetic check error ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dynatrace-perfclinics/dynatrace-getting-started/main/images/howto_synthetic_executionoverview.png)\n5. Analyze a failed execution and see which step failed ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dynatrace-perfclinics/dynatrace-getting-started/main/images/howto_synthetic_executiondetails.png)\n6. Understand the full waterfall of requests and see which one failed ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dynatrace-perfclinics/dynatrace-getting-started/main/images/howto_synthetic_analyzewaterfall.png)\n7.
