Analyze a Davis-detected Problem and find root cause information\n**Problem Statement:** As an owner of an application, infrastructure or platform I need to know the impact and root cause of any ongoing issues.\n\n**How Dynatrace helps:** Dynatrace Davis AI automatically detects anomalies across the entire stack and automatically captures all relevant impact and root cause information in a single Davis-detected Problem. This problem ticket is the start of your detailed investigation and can also be used to trigger an automation workflow to notify stakeholders or auto-remediate the problem.\n\n**Steps**:\n1. Open the [Problems App](https://wkf10640.apps.dynatrace.com/ui/apps/dynatrace.classic.problems/ui/problems)\n2. Select a problem of interest (expand timeframe, filter on problem type or impact) ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dynatrace-perfclinics/dynatrace-getting-started/main/images/howto_problems_overview.png)\n3. Understand Impact and Root Cause ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dynatrace-perfclinics/dynatrace-getting-started/main/images/howto_problems_problemdetails.png)\n4. Navigate to root cause service ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dynatrace-perfclinics/dynatrace-getting-started/main/images/howto_problems_rootcausesvc_overview.png)\n5. Analyze root cause events and logs ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dynatrace-perfclinics/dynatrace-getting-started/main/images/howto_problems_rootcausesvc_events_logs.png)\n6.
