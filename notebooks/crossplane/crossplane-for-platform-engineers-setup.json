If not, ensure the Crossplane Helm chart was successfully redeployed and all pods have restarted.\n\nTo inspect the metrics Crossplane exposes, set up port forwarding to the service on port 8080 and use curl to fetch the metrics:\n\n```sh\nkubectl \\\n  --namespace crossplane-system \\\n  port-forward deployment/crossplane 8080:8080\n```\n\n```sh\ncurl http://localhost:8080/metrics\n```"

This applies to most providers, so additional configuration is typically not required.\n\n## How to Verify if a Provider Was Generated with Upjet?\n\n1. **Search in the Upbound Marketplace**: Look for the provider in the [Upbound Marketplace](https://marketplace.upbound.io/providers). Providers with the \"Upbound Official\" tag are managed by the official Crossplane team and automatically expose metrics.\n2. **Check Provider Documentation**: If the provider does not have the \"Upbound Official\" tag, review the provider's README or documentation for mentions of upjet or metrics to confirm metrics exposure.\n\n## What if My Provider Was Not Generated with Upjet?\n\nIf your provider was not generated with Upjet, you will need to refer to the provider's documentation or explore issues within the community for guidance on metric exposure. You might also consider contributing to the provider's development to include metric exposure. This guide assumes that the metrics defined in the [Upjet documentation](https://github.com/crossplane/upjet/blob/main/docs/monitoring.md) are exposed."

If not, ensure the Crossplane Helm chart was successfully redeployed and all pods have restarted.\n\n```yaml\nannotations:\n  metrics.dynatrace.com/scrape: \"true\"\n  metrics.dynatrace.com/port: \"8080\"\n  metrics.dynatrace.com/path: \"/metrics\"\n```\n\n## Scrape Crossplane Provider Metrics\n\nDefine a [DeploymentRuntimeConfig](https://docs.crossplane.io/latest/concepts/providers/#runtime-configuration) to apply Dynatrace scraping settings across all provider deployments and pods:\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: pkg.crossplane.io/v1beta1\nkind: DeploymentRuntimeConfig\nmetadata:\n  name: default\n  namespace: crossplane-system\nspec:\n  deploymentTemplate:\n    metadata:\n      annotations:\n        metrics.dynatrace.com/scrape: \"true\"\n        metrics.dynatrace.com/port: \"8080\"\n        metrics.dynatrace.com/path: /metrics\n    spec:\n      selector: {}\n      template:\n        metadata:\n          annotations:\n            metrics.dynatrace.com/scrape: \"true\"\n            metrics.dynatrace.com/port: \"8080\"\n            metrics.dynatrace.com/path: /metrics\n```\n\nDeploy this configuration to your cluster:\n\n```sh\nkubectl apply -f deployment-runtime-config.yaml\n```\n\nAfter deploying, check the provider pods to confirm that the annotations are set. For the [Upbound AWS provider] you could inspect the pod with this command:\n\n```sh\nkubectl \\\n  --namespace crossplane-system \\\n  --output yaml \\\n  get deployment provider-aws \\\n  | grep 'annotations:' -A 6\n```\n\nYou should see the necessary annotations listed similarly as shown for the Crossplane metrics.\n"
