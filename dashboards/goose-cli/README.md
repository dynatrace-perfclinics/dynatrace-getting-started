[Goose](https://block.github.io/goose/) is an open source, locally installed CLI that lets you swap out backend models,
use multiple MCP servers and define re-usable "recipes" for common tasks.

Goose offers well structured JSONL logs and OpenTelemetry (OTLP) metrics and traces.

The contents of this folder demonstrate how to monitor Goose in Dynatrace.
