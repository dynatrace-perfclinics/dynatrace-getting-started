Note: Since the introduction of the Grail security table, up-to-date artifacts are now delivered directly in-product through new integrations.
As a result, the artifacts in this repository are no longer maintained and will become outdated.
For further details, see the [Grail security table migration guide](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/secure/threat-observability/migration).
